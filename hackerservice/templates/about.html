  <h2 class="visually-hidden">Our mission</h2>
  <p>
    HackerService began as a lightweight demonstration of how a software-as-a-service
    marketplace might look. All of the "hacking" products listed are entirely fictional
    and offered only to illustrate various payment and affiliate features.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project is maintained by security enthusiasts who believe in sharing knowledge.
    None of the services here are real &mdash; please do not attempt to purchase them
    for any actual hacking activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Source code for this demo is available online should you wish to explore how it works.
